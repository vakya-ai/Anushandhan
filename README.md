## Core Features

### 1. Code to Research Paper (Core Feature)

Automatically convert GitHub repositories or codebases into structured research paper drafts. The engine intelligently extracts methodology, architecture, results, and can even generate visual assets using AI. Ideal for hackathons, engineering documentation, and academic submissions.

### 2. AI Assistant

A context-aware assistant guides users through:

* Drafting content section by section
* Refining writing style and tone
* Generating citations and summaries
* Translating and rephrasing content
* Creating images, charts, and illustrations from text

### 3. Research Summarization

Users can input URLs, PDFs, or raw text to:

* Extract abstracts and summaries
* Identify key insights and contributions
* Generate visual annotations
* Interact with content via a conversational interface

### 4. Role-Based Collaborative Authoring

Create multi-user paper workspaces with real-time editing and versioning. Roles include:

* Admin: Full control over paper and permissions
* Main Author: Editing and structuring responsibilities
* Reviewer: Commenting and suggesting edits
* Guest: Read-only or prompt-limited contribution

### 5. Template and Prompt Library

Non-technical users can generate academic content through guided workflows including:

* Blog post generation from technical input
* Research paper outlines from simple prompts
* Articles and literature reviews based on minimal input

### 6. Citation Insertion

Integrated search and auto-insertion of citations from:

* ArXiv
* CrossRef
* Semantic Scholar
* Google Scholar
* DOIs and BibTeX imports

### 7. Multilingual Content Support

Generate and translate research outputs in 25+ languages using context-aware translation aligned to academic standards.

### 8. AI-Generated Visual Assets

Convert paper content or custom prompts into:

* Architecture diagrams
* Flowcharts
* Visual abstracts
* Figures and tables

### 9. Export Options

Support for one-click export to:

* PDF (with configurable templates such as IEEE, ACM, etc.)
* DOCX (Microsoft Word)
* LaTeX (journal-ready)
* Markdown and HTML (for web publishing)

### 10. Paper Organization and Management

Use a custom folder structure in the left navigation bar to:
