## ðŸš€ AI Research Paper Generator
The **AI Research Paper Generator** is an innovative platform designed to help users generate well-written research papers in specified formats like **IEEE** or **Springer**. The AI will analyze input sources such as **GitHub repositories** or **code folders** to automatically create structured research papers. The **Alpha Version** focuses on generating IEEE-formatted papers with good-to-average humanized content based on two input methods: **GitHub Repository link** and **code project folder**.

## ðŸ—º Roadmap for Alpha Version (V1)

### **Phase 1: Planning and Research**
1. **Understand Prerequisites**:
   - Learn the basics of **FastAPI** for backend development.
   - Familiarize yourself with **React.js** and **Tailwind CSS** for frontend.
   - Dive into **Hugging Face Transformers** and **LangChain** for building AI pipelines.
   - Understand **MongoDB** for database management.
   - Get hands-on with **Redis** for caching and task queues.

2. **Design the System**:
   - Define the API endpoints for user inputs (e.g., GitHub repo links, file uploads).
   - Plan the database schema to store user data, inputs, and generated outputs.
   - Sketch out frontend UI mockups for the upload interface and result display.

---

### **Phase 2: Backend Development**
1. **Setup Environment**:
   - Create a Python virtual environment.
   - Install FastAPI, MongoDB driver (`pymongo`), and Redis library (`redis-py`).
   - Containerize the backend using Docker.

2. **Build APIs**:
   - **User Input API**: Handle GitHub repository links and project folder uploads.
   - **Paper Generation API**: Integrate the AI model for content generation.
   - **Database Management**: Save user input and results in MongoDB.
   - **Queue System**: Use Redis to queue and process requests asynchronously.

3. **Integrate AI Pipeline**:
   - Use Hugging Face Transformers to fine-tune a model for research paper generation.
   - Use sentence-transformers to extract text from the codebase or GitHub repositories.
   - Build an AI pipeline using LangChain to convert the extracted data into research paper content.

---

### **Phase 3: Frontend Development**
1. **Setup React.js Environment**:
   - Install React.js and Tailwind CSS.
   - Create components for file upload and input forms.
   - Use Axios to connect to backend APIs.

2. **Develop Key Features**:
   - User Authentication (optional for Alpha version).
   - File/URL input forms.
   - Display generated research paper content.

3. **Styling**:
   - Use Tailwind CSS for a clean and responsive design.

---

### **Phase 4: Testing and Deployment**
1. **Testing**:
   - Unit test backend APIs using Pytest.
   - Test AI model outputs with various inputs to ensure quality.
   - Perform end-to-end testing of frontend and backend integration.

2. **Deployment**:
   - Use Docker Compose to deploy the app.
   - Host the backend on a platform like AWS EC2 or Heroku.
   - Use a static hosting service (e.g., Vercel or Netlify) for the frontend.
